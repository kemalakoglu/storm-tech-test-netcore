# Notes

## Database
	I connected MS-SQL Server to create database scripts to show which data I worked with. Please, run the script then configure the connection string on appsettings.json
	
## Missing Tasks
	I couldn't deliver task 8 and 9 because of the time limitation. If I had more time than 5 hours, I would create a pop up page for insert TodoItem and reading the avatar data from UserManager regarding to ASP.NET Identity Server
	
## EF Versions
	I updated EF Libraries to version 6 because version 5 was depreciated
